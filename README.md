# transfer_learning_dogs_vs_cats
This program uses transfer learning via PyTorch for the binary classification task of determining if a picture is of a cat or dog. It's pretrained using the ResNet18 model's weights and fine-tuned with a dataset of a little over 1000 images of cats and dogs from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/cats-and-dogs-image-classification/data

## Requirements
pip install torch torchvision d2l

Run in Jupyter Notebooks to see images
